1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

Intro:

*HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol
*It is a method that the computers and servers use to request and send information

(Eg: when we search cricbuzz.com on a browser,
*the browser sends an HTTP request to the respective server
*then the server sends HTTP response 
*finally the browser changes the response to a understandable format for the users
*This is process is done by DNS)
*HTTP was created in 1997 and developed 
*It is called as HTTP 1.1
*A new version of HTTP was called HTTP 2 in 2015.

Difference:

*HTTP 2 is much faster and more efficient than the HTTP 1.1.
*It is because of how it prioritizes content during the loading process
*HTTP 1.1 uses more tcp connections than the HTTP 2 .

For example,
(*HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
*HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource)
*Thus, HTTP 2 is more faster and efficient than the older version HTTP 1.1
